Bring code up to accessibility standards

### Change notes:

* Updated title to company name (Horiseon) - this allows the name to show on the tab.

* Replaced div tags with appropriate tags.

* Reduced specific classes with repetitive code into more general section classes. 

* alt attribute added to images to be filled in with appropriate verbage. 

* Added comments to make code easier to read.


### Currently:

Site has limited movement. Clicking the links in the header section (Search Engine Optimization, Online Repuatation Management and Social Media Marketing) will bring you to the location of the section.
